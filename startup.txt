First things first: boy or girl?

		*goto Girl
	#Non-Binary
		Oh, alright... I suppose.
		*set boy "non"
		
		What pronouns, then?
		*choice
			#Masculine - he, his, him
				*goto Boy
			#Feminine  - she, her, her
				*goto Girl
			#Non - nhe, nhis, nhim 
				*goto Non
			#Custom -- set own pronouns.
				*label InputP
				Instead of "him" or "her", it would be
				*input_text him
				Instead of "his" or "her", it would be
				*input_text his
				Finally, instead of "he" or "she", it would be
				*input_text he
				In conclusion, your pronouns are ${him}, ${his}, and ${he}. Is this correct?
				*choice
					#Yes
						*gosub Name?

			Alright, alright! Jeez...
			
			This narrative covers one's personal interactions within the "Choice of Games" forums. Notably, the sections that will be covered are the different levels of expertise held within the forum, the amount of activity observable inside the forum, one's ability to help those in need, and one's future plans; as per usual, I will interlace other information within these broad subjects.
