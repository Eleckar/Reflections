Abstract

---

This narrative covers one's personal interactions within the "Choice of Games" forums. Notably, the sections that will be covered are the different levels of expertise held within the forum, the amount of activity observable inside the forum, one's ability to help those in need, and one's future plans; as per usual, I will interlace other information within these broad subjects.
